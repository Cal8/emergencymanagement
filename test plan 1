8. Local Hazard Mitigation Plan Review 

In an effort to encourage discussion between local, State, and Federal Partners, local mitigation plans were briefly reviewed for potential update opportunities prior to each of the twelve (12) local five (5) regional outreach meetings. Marylandâ€™s approach to defining and creating resilient communities has resulted in various data resources and tools. Sharing resources and tools was the primary intent of the regional outreach meetings. To that end, each jurisdiction was provided with a review table that included three (3) columns: location, plan element, and update opportunity. The pages referred to in the location column of the review table were printed and attached. Attaching the local plan pages provided meeting participants with information from their current plan that could be updated using the new resources and tools presented during the regional outreach meetings. These plan review tables are distributed and reviewed during local plan kickoff meeting by MEMA mitigation staff.
